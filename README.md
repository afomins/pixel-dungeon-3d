# Intro
*"Pixel Dungeon 3D"* is mod for original *"Pixel Dungeon"* (forked from [here](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon)) that adds new 3D renderer and new GUI. This mod does not alter game logic, nor it adds any new gameplay elements - it's still good ol' *"Pixel Dungeon"* with new 3D visuals and different controls.

This was my hobby project that I was coding on my free time for 18 months. It is still half-finished and needs a lot of polishing, but I'm not going to continue development right now because I'm really tired of it! 

I'll just leave it over here and switch to other projects.

# Downloads
*"Pixel Dungeon 3D"* `v0.2.8` binaries:
 * Desktop JAR - https://github.com/afomins/pixel-dungeon-3d/releases/download/v0.2.8/pd3d-v0.2.8.jar
 * Android APK - https://github.com/afomins/pixel-dungeon-3d/releases/download/v0.2.8/pd3d-v0.2.8.apk

# GIFs
Following GIFs show how 3D mod looks like comparing to original. Each GIF captures output of two windows:
 * In left window you see **Desktop** version of *Pixel Dungeon 3D* `v0.2.8` which acts as *client*
 * In right window you see **Android emulator** with original *Pixel Dungeon* `v1.9.7` which acts as *server*
 
When doing standalone release I compile *client* and *server* into single app and, but to record those GIFs I launched *client* (i.e. 3D engine) and *server* (i.e. original *Pixel Dungeon*) as different processes connected via `java-websocket`. This allowed me to capture output of both processes while they were negotiating with each other and rendering **same** game session.

# Implementation details
*Pixel Dungeon 3D* source code is split between 4 git repositories:
1. [`pixel-dungeon.git`](https://github.com/afomins/pixel-dungeon) - forked original *Pixel Dungeon* project which acts as *server*. All gameplay logic is located in this repository

2. [`pixel-dungeon-classes.git`](https://github.com/afomins/pixel-dungeon-classes) - forked original *PD classes* project that is being used by `pixel-dungeon.git`

3. [`pixel-dungeon-3d.git`](https://github.com/afomins/pixel-dungeon-3d) - root project that contains 3D engine core and acts as *client*. This repository contains code that receives game state from *server* and renders it in 3D space via `libgdx`

4. [`pixel-dungeon-3d-lib.git`](https://github.com/afomins/pixel-dungeon-3d-lib) - shared code that is being used by both `pixel-dungeon.git` (i.e. *server*) and `pixel-dungeon-3d.git`(i.e. *client*) and contain packages that:
     
     a. Serialize game state and send it from *server* to *client* 
     
     b. Send game commands in opposite direction from *client* to *server*

Following external packages are managed by *Gradle* which should automatically download them and update project file accordingly:
1. `org.json:json:20180130`
2. `org.mini2Dx:universal-tween-engine:6.3.3`
3. `org.java-websocket:Java-WebSocket:1.3.8`
4. `com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx:1.9.8`
5. `com.kotcrab.vis:vis-ui:1.4.0`
6. `com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.2`

# Preparing *"IntelliJ IDEA"* project (aka *"Android Studio"*)
1. Create root project from [`pixel-dungeon-3d.git`](https://github.com/afomins/pixel-dungeon-3d):
   
   Create new *IntelliJ IDEA* project by cloning `git@github.com:afomins/pixel-dungeon-3d.git` repository into `./pd3d` directory.
   
   In *"Import project"* window select `"Gradle"` and then tap `"Create separate module per source set"` checkbox.
   
   When *Gradle sync* is over then you should see `pd3d` project with `core`, `desktop` and `android` modules.
   
2. Import [`pixel-dungeon-3d-lib.git`](https://github.com/afomins/pixel-dungeon-3d-lib):

   Clone `git@github.com:afomins/pixel-dungeon-3d-lib.git` to `./pd3d/core/pixel-dungeon-3d-lib` directory (you can do this by navigating to `VCS -> Checkout from Version Control -> Git` menu)
   
   (Press `No` if *IntelliJ IDEA* asks you to create new project)
   
3. Import [`pixel-dungeon-classes.git`](https://github.com/afomins/pixel-dungeon-classes):

   Clone `git@github.com:afomins/pixel-dungeon-classes.git` to `./pd3d/core/pixel-dungeon-classes` directory.
   
   (Press `No` if *IntelliJ IDEA* asks you to create new project)

4. Import [`pixel-dungeon.git`](https://github.com/afomins/pixel-dungeon):

   Clone `git@github.com:afomins/pixel-dungeon.git` to `./pd3d/core/pixel-dungeon` directory.
   
   (Press `No` if *IntelliJ IDEA* asks you to create new project)
   

When you complete above mentioned steps then your project should have following structure:
```
   pd3d
     |
     +-- core
     |     | 
     |     +-- pixel-dungeon-3d-lib
     |     |
     |     +-- pixel-dungeon-classes
     |     |
     |     +-- pixel-dungeon
     |
     +-- desktop
     |
     +-- android
```


**IMPORTANT** - you should manually copy original game assets (`*.png` and `*.mp3` files) from `./pd3d/core/pixel-dungeon/assets` to `./pd3d/android/assets`. (**TODO:** Automate this step with *Gradle*)

# Build instructions (Desktop JAR)
Select `./pd3d/android/assets` as your working directory and run `com.matalok.pd3d.desktop.DesktopLauncher` class.

**IMPORTANT** - I've been developing for Java8 that's why it might not compile/run with different Java version.

# Build instructions (Android APK)
Building for Android is a little bit trickier than building for Desktop because all `android.*` and `javax.*` imports from native *Pixel Dungeon* project should be renamed to `stub.android.*` and `stub.javax.*` accordigly.

For instance:
```
import javax.microedition.khronos.opengles.GL10;  -> import stub.javax.microedition.khronos.opengles.GL10;
import android.opengl.GLES20;                     -> import stub.android.opengl.GLES20;
```

This step is *"necessary evil"* which ensures that native *Pixel Dungeon* sources call custom methods from `stub.android.*` packages instead of `android.*`. 

To automate this task I created `./pd3d/scripts/stubs.sh` shell script that can add/delete this **stub hack** when necessary. 

The only problem with this script is that it uses `/bin/bash` syntax which can be run either from Linux or Cygwin.

1. Navigate to `./pd3d/scripts` directory
2. Run `./stubs.sh add` to replace `android.*` package import with `stub.android.*`
3. Run `com.matalok.pd3d.AndroidLauncher` activity
4. Run `./stubs.sh del` to revert `stub.adnroid.*` back to `android.*`
